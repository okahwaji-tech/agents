We'll introduce the main paradigms of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) to frame where LLM training fits, setting the stage for the RL integration throughout this curriculum. The mathematical foundations will focus on probability theory and information theory concepts that underpin language modeling. Healthcare applications will introduce you to the unique challenges and opportunities of applying LLMs in medical contexts, including regulatory considerations and safety requirements that are crucial for your work at Allergan Data Labs.

**Mathematical Foundations (3-4 hours):**
Understanding the mathematical concepts that power language modeling is crucial for mastering LLMs. This week focuses on:

**Reinforcement Learning Focus:**

While this week centers on understanding LLMs through supervised learning principles, it's important to understand how reinforcement learning concepts apply to language modeling and will become crucial in later weeks:

1. **Sequential Decision Making Perspective**: Language generation can be viewed as a sequential decision-making process where at each step, the model must decide which token to generate next. This is analogous to an RL agent choosing actions in an environment. Understanding this perspective prepares you for advanced techniques like RLHF where the model learns to make better "decisions" (token choices) based on human feedback.

2. **Reward Signals in Language**: While traditional language modeling uses likelihood as the training signal, modern LLM alignment techniques use human preferences as reward signals. This week's exploration of model outputs on medical text will help you understand why simple likelihood maximization isn't sufficient for safe, helpful AI systems.

3. **Agent-Environment Framework**: Begin thinking about LLMs as agents that interact with their environment (the conversation context) and receive feedback (human responses, task success). This mental model will be essential when we cover LLM agents in Phase 4.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The temperature and sampling parameters you experiment with this week control the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in text generation. Higher temperature means more exploration (diverse outputs), lower temperature means more exploitation (predictable outputs). This concept directly parallels RL exploration strategies.

Understanding these connections now will make the RL integration in later weeks much more intuitive and help you see how modern LLM techniques are fundamentally about learning better decision-making policies.

### Week 2: Transformer Architecture – Attention Mechanism Deep Dive

**Topic Overview:** This week dives deep into the architecture that underpins virtually all modern LLMs: the Transformer. Building on Week 1's probability foundations, you'll understand why Transformers replaced RNNs for language tasks and how the revolutionary self-attention mechanism works to encode language context. The mathematical focus shifts to the linear algebra and signal processing concepts that power attention mechanisms, while healthcare applications explore how attention patterns can be interpreted for medical AI explainability. You'll study the key components: tokenization, positional embeddings, self-attention layers, feed-forward networks, and output logits. Understanding the forward pass of a Transformer and how attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of input sequences is crucial for everything that follows. The RL connection introduces the concept of attention as a form of "soft" action selection, where the model learns to attend to relevant information rather than making hard decisions about what to process.

   - Gradient analysis: how softmax gradients flow during backpropagation
   - Numerical stability considerations: why we subtract the maximum before computing softmax
   - Connection to probability distributions: softmax as a way to convert logits to probabilities

3. **Positional Encoding Mathematics** (1 hour):

Focus specifically on Section 3.2 (Attention) and understand the mathematical formulation of scaled dot-product attention. Pay careful attention to Figure 1 (the Transformer architecture diagram) and Figure 2 (attention visualization). The key insight is how the Transformer uses **multi-head self-attention** to pay selective attention to different positions in text simultaneously. Work through the mathematical formulations and understand why this approach is more parallelizable than RNNs while capturing long-range dependencies more effectively.

2. **Illustrated guide to Transformers (blog or video)** – Find a high-quality visual explanation of the Transformer architecture (Jay Alammar's "The Illustrated Transformer" is excellent). This should be a beginner-friendly walk-through of an encoder-decoder Transformer and the role of attention in machine translation. Focus on understanding how information flows through the architecture and how attention weights are computed and applied. The visual representations will help solidify the mathematical concepts from the Vaswani paper.

3. **Stanford CS234 (2024) – Lectures 2-3: Tabular MDP Planning and Policy Evaluation** – While not directly about Transformers, these lectures introduce the mathematical framework for sequential decision making that will become relevant when we discuss LLM agents. Focus on understanding how value functions and policies work in discrete state spaces. The connection to attention is that attention can be viewed as a learned policy for information selection – the model learns to "attend" to relevant information based on the current context.

**Reinforcement Learning Focus:**

The attention mechanism has fascinating connections to reinforcement learning concepts that will become more apparent as we progress:

1. **Attention as Soft Action Selection**: In RL, an agent must decide which actions to take at each step. Attention can be viewed as a "soft" version of this – instead of making hard decisions about which information to process, the model learns to weight all information and focus more on relevant parts. This soft selection is differentiable and allows for gradient-based learning, unlike hard selection mechanisms.

2. **Value Functions and Attention**: The Value matrix in attention can be thought of as containing the "value" of each position's information, similar to value functions in RL that estimate the worth of different states. The attention weights determine how much of each position's value to incorporate into the final representation.

3. **Policy Learning for Information Selection**: The Query-Key interaction that determines attention weights can be viewed as a learned policy for information selection. Just as RL agents learn policies that map states to action probabilities, attention mechanisms learn to map contexts (queries) to information selection patterns (attention weights over keys).

4. **Sequential Decision Making**: While attention processes all positions simultaneously, the autoregressive generation process in LLMs involves sequential decisions about which token to generate next. Understanding attention prepares you for more advanced RL techniques where models learn to make these sequential decisions based on reward signals rather than just likelihood maximization.

5. **Exploration in Attention**: The temperature parameter in softmax attention controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off, similar to ε-greedy policies in RL. Higher temperatures lead to more uniform attention (exploration), while lower temperatures create sharper, more focused attention (exploitation).

This perspective on attention as a learned information selection mechanism will be crucial when we cover RLHF in Week 8, where models learn to attend to information that leads to human-preferred outputs, and when we discuss LLM agents in Phase 4, where attention patterns can be viewed as part of the agent's decision-making process.

You'll learn about the *language modeling objective* (predicting the next token) and variants like masked language modeling, understanding why this simple objective leads to such powerful capabilities. We'll explore the concept of *emergent abilities* as model size increases, introducing the mathematical framework of scaling laws that predict how model performance improves with scale. The healthcare focus examines medical text corpora and the unique challenges of training on medical data, including privacy considerations and domain-specific evaluation metrics. Mathematical foundations will cover optimization theory, statistical analysis of scaling relationships, and information theory concepts that explain why language modeling works.

Understand how the simple next-word prediction objective leads to few-shot learning capabilities. Pay special attention to the training data composition and how different data sources contribute to model capabilities. The key insight is that scale alone, combined with the language modeling objective, can produce models that perform tasks they weren't explicitly trained for.

2. **Kaplan et al. (2020), *"Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models"*** – This foundational paper establishes the mathematical relationships between model size, data size, compute, and performance.

**Reinforcement Learning Focus:**

Pre-training connects to RL concepts in several important ways that will become more apparent in later weeks:

1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation in Language Modeling**: During pre-training, models must balance between predicting likely tokens (exploitation) and maintaining diversity to learn from all parts of the data distribution (exploration). The temperature parameter in sampling and the stochastic nature of training provide this exploration, similar to ε-greedy policies in RL.

2. **Reward Signal Interpretation**: While pre-training uses likelihood as the training signal, this can be viewed as a dense reward signal where the model gets immediate feedback for each token prediction. This contrasts with the sparse rewards often encountered in RL, but the mathematical frameworks are related.

3. **Policy Learning Perspective**: The language model can be viewed as learning a policy that maps contexts to probability distributions over next tokens. This policy learning perspective becomes crucial when we cover RLHF in Week 8, where the model's policy is further refined using human preference signals.

4. **Multi-Armed Bandit Connection**: The choice of which token to generate next can be viewed as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each possible token is an "arm" and the reward is related to how well that token fits the context. The softmax distribution over tokens is similar to probability matching in bandit algorithms.

5. **Curriculum Learning**: The order in which training examples are presented can be viewed as a form of curriculum learning, which has connections to RL concepts of shaping and progressive task difficulty. Understanding how pre-training data ordering affects learning prepares you for more sophisticated RL-based training procedures.

This perspective on pre-training as a form of policy learning with dense rewards will be essential when we transition to explicit RL techniques for alignment and when we discuss LLM agents that must learn to interact with environments beyond just text prediction.

Understanding how embeddings preserve and lose information is crucial for RL applications where the state representation determines what the agent can learn.

2. **Feature Learning and Abstraction**: The process of learning embeddings is similar to learning state abstractions in RL, where the goal is to identify features that are relevant for the task while ignoring irrelevant details. This connection becomes important when we discuss LLM agents that must learn to represent their environment effectively.

3. **Representation Learning as Exploration**: The process of learning good embeddings can be viewed as a form of exploration in representation space, where the model must discover which features are important for the task. This connects to exploration strategies in RL and will be relevant when we discuss how LLMs learn to represent new domains.

4. **Transfer Learning and Generalization**: Good embeddings enable transfer learning across tasks and domains, similar to how good state representations in RL enable transfer across different environments. Understanding embedding transferability prepares you for understanding how LLMs can be adapted to new domains through fine-tuning.

5. **Reward Signal Representation**: In RLHF (which we'll cover in Week 8), human preferences must be represented in a way that can guide learning. Understanding how embeddings capture semantic relationships helps understand how preference signals can be effectively represented and used for training.

This perspective on embeddings as learned state representations that enable effective learning and transfer will be crucial when we discuss LLM agents and alignment techniques that rely on good representations of both text and human preferences.

**Reinforcement Learning Focus:**

Prompt engineering connects to RL concepts in several fundamental ways that prepare you for advanced techniques:

1. **Prompts as Policy Specification**: Prompts can be viewed as a way to specify or constrain the policy that the language model follows. Just as RL agents learn policies that map states to actions, prompts guide how the model maps contexts to outputs. Understanding this connection prepares you for techniques like Constitutional AI where explicit rules guide model behavior.

2. **Few-Shot Learning as Meta-Learning**: The few-shot learning capabilities demonstrated through prompting are related to meta-learning in RL, where agents learn to quickly adapt to new tasks. The mathematical principles of how examples provide information for rapid adaptation are similar in both domains.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation in Prompting**: The choice of prompt formulation involves a trade-off between exploiting known effective patterns and exploring new approaches. This mirrors the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL and prepares you for understanding how models balance between safe and creative outputs.

4. **Reward Signal Design**: Effective prompts often implicitly specify what constitutes good performance, similar to reward function design in RL. Understanding how prompt formulation affects model objectives prepares you for explicit reward modeling in RLHF.

5. **Interactive Learning**: Prompt engineering often involves iterative refinement based on model outputs, similar to the interactive learning process in RL. This iterative improvement process mirrors how RL agents learn from environment feedback.

6. **Context as State Representation**: The context provided in prompts serves as a state representation that the model uses to determine appropriate actions (outputs). Understanding how context affects model behavior prepares you for understanding how LLM agents represent and use environmental state information.

This perspective on prompting as a form of policy guidance and interactive learning will be essential when we cover RLHF in Week 8, where explicit reward signals replace implicit prompt-based guidance, and when we discuss LLM agents in Phase 4, where prompts evolve into more sophisticated forms of agent instruction and goal specification.

**Topic Overview:** This week introduces cutting-edge safety and alignment techniques that are crucial for deploying LLMs in healthcare and other high-stakes domains. You'll study Constitutional AI (CAI), a revolutionary approach developed by Anthropic that uses AI systems to critique and revise their own outputs according to a set of principles or "constitution."

**Reinforcement Learning Focus:**

Fine-tuning connects to several important RL concepts that become more prominent in advanced LLM techniques:

1. **Policy Adaptation**: Fine-tuning can be viewed as adapting a pre-trained policy (the language model) to new tasks or domains. This connects directly to policy adaptation techniques in RL, where agents must transfer learned policies to new environments. Understanding this connection prepares you for RLHF, where policies are adapted based on human feedback.

2. **Curriculum Learning**: Effective fine-tuning often involves carefully designed learning curricula, similar to curriculum learning in RL where agents learn complex tasks through progressive difficulty. The mathematical principles of curriculum design apply to both fine-tuning sequences and RL training progressions.

3. **Catastrophic Forgetting and Continual Learning**: The challenge of preserving pre-trained knowledge while learning new tasks parallels continual learning problems in RL, where agents must learn new tasks without forgetting previous capabilities. Mathematical techniques for preventing forgetting are similar in both domains.

4. **Multi-Task Learning**: Fine-tuning for multiple related tasks connects to multi-task RL, where agents learn to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Understanding the mathematical trade-offs between task-specific and shared representations prepares you for advanced RL techniques.

5. **Exploration vs. Exploitation in Learning**: Fine-tuning involves balancing between exploiting pre-trained knowledge and exploring new task-specific patterns. This mirrors the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL and prepares you for understanding how RLHF balances between existing model capabilities and human preference learning.

6. **Reward Shaping**: The choice of fine-tuning objectives and regularization terms can be viewed as a form of reward shaping, where we guide the learning process toward desired behaviors. This connects directly to reward shaping techniques in RL and prepares you for understanding how human preferences can be incorporated as reward signals.

This perspective on fine-tuning as policy adaptation with curriculum learning and continual learning considerations provides essential foundation for understanding RLHF in Week 8, where explicit human feedback replaces supervised fine-tuning objectives, and for the advanced agent techniques in Phase 4, where fine-tuned models must adapt to dynamic environments and tasks.
