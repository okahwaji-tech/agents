### 1.1 Axioms and Properties of Vector Spaces

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Vector Space"
    A **vector space** (or linear space) is a set $V$ equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication, satisfying a specific list of axioms. Intuitively, vectors can be added together and scaled by numbers (scalars) while staying in the same set.

Formally, for a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ (e.g., real numbers $\mathbb{R}$), the following properties must hold for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V$ and scalars $a, b \in F$:

!!! example "üî¢ The Ten Fundamental Axioms"

    **1. Closure under Addition:**

    $$\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V$$

    Adding any two vectors yields another vector in $V$.

    **2. Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**

    $$a \mathbf{v} \in V$$

    Scaling any vector by any scalar yields a vector in $V$.

    **3. Commutativity of Addition:**

    $$\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}$$

    **4. Associativity of Addition:**

    $$(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})$$

    **5. Additive Identity:**

    There exists a zero vector $\mathbf{0} \in V$ such that:

    $$\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v} \text{ for all } \mathbf{v} \in V$$

    **6. Additive Inverse:**

    For each $\mathbf{v} \in V$, there is a vector $-\mathbf{v} \in V$ such that:

    $$\mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}$$

    **7. Multiplicative Identity:**

    $$1 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \text{ for all } \mathbf{v} \in V$$

    where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in the field $F$.

    **8. Associativity of Scalar Multiplication:**

    $$(ab)\mathbf{v} = a(b\mathbf{v})$$

    **9. Distributivity of Scalar over Vector Addition:**

    $$a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}$$

    **10. Distributivity of Vectors over Scalar Addition:**

    $$(a + b)\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{v}$$

!!! tip "üîë Key Insight"
    These axioms ensure that $V$ has an algebraic structure allowing **linear combinations**. A key consequence of the first two axioms (closure properties) is that no matter how you add or scale vectors in $V$, you remain in $V$.

The middle set of axioms provides the familiar behavior of addition (commutativity, associativity, identity, inverses). The last few axioms govern how scalar multiplication interacts with addition and itself. If a set with two operations satisfies all these axioms, it is a vector space.

!!! warning "‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note"
    These axioms implicitly require the presence of a zero vector and additive inverses (via the identity and inverse axioms), so every vector space contains a special zero element and each vector's negation.

### 1.2 Examples of Vector Spaces in Machine Learning

!!! info "üåü Generality of Vector Spaces"
    The concept of vector space is very general ‚Äì it is not limited to the geometric arrows in 2D or 3D. Classic examples include:

!!! example "üìä Common Vector Space Examples"

    === "Real Number Line"
        **$\mathbb{R}$ - The Real Number Line**

        All real numbers form a 1-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ under standard addition and multiplication.

        - **Zero vector:** $0$
        - **Operations:** Standard arithmetic
        - **Dimension:** 1

    === "Euclidean Space"
        **$\mathbb{R}^n$ - Euclidean Space**

        The set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers (column vectors of length $n$) is an $n$-dimensional vector space.

        **Component-wise operations:**

        $$\text{Addition: } (x_1,y_1,z_1)+(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2, z_1+z_2)$$

        $$\text{Scalar multiplication: } a(x,y,z)=(ax, ay, az)$$

    === "Polynomial Spaces"
        **Polynomial Vector Spaces**

        The set of all polynomials (with real coefficients) of degree $\leq k$ is a vector space.

        - **Vectors:** Polynomials $p(x)$
        - **Addition:** Polynomial addition
        - **Scalars:** Real numbers multiplying polynomials
        - **Example:** Quadratic polynomials $ax^2+bx+c$ form a 3-dimensional vector space

    === "Matrix Spaces"
        **Matrix Vector Spaces**

        The set of all $m\times n$ matrices with entries from a field is a vector space.

        **Example calculation:**

        $$2 \begin{pmatrix}1 & 4\\3 & 5\end{pmatrix} + (-1)\begin{pmatrix}0 & 2\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$

        $$= \begin{pmatrix}2 & 8\\6 & 10\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}0 & -2\\-1 & -1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}2 & 6\\5 & 9\end{pmatrix}$$

    === "Function Spaces"
        **Function Vector Spaces**

        The set of all real-valued functions on a domain (e.g., $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$) is a vector space.

        **Operations:**

        $$\text{Addition: } (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$$

        $$\text{Scalar multiplication: } (a\cdot f)(x)=a \cdot f(x)$$

!!! tip "üí° Abstract Nature of Vector Spaces"
    These examples highlight how abstract the vector space concept is ‚Äì as long as the elements and operations obey the axioms, we have a vector space. The geometric 2D/3D vectors are just one instance. This abstraction lets us apply linear algebra to many contexts (polynomials, matrices, functions, etc.), not just physical vectors.

!!! question "‚ùì Why Are These Properties Important?"
    They guarantee that **linear combinations** make sense in $V$. If $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ are in $V$, any linear combination:

    $$a_1\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + a_k\mathbf{v}_k$$

    is also a vector in $V$. This closure under linear combination enables powerful techniques like solving linear equations, defining bases and dimensions, and more.

### 1.3 Vector Spaces in LLM Architectures

!!! example "ü§ñ ML Applications of Vector Spaces"
    Almost all data and parameters in machine learning are represented in vector spaces. This fundamental structure enables the mathematical operations that power modern AI systems.

#### üî§ Word Embeddings and Semantic Arithmetic

In NLP models, embeddings are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., $d = 768$ for BERT). These embedding spaces obey the vector space axioms, allowing meaningful arithmetic on representations.

!!! tip "üí° Famous Word Analogy Example"
    **"King is to Queen as Man is to Woman"**

    In a good word embedding space, you can perform vector arithmetic:

    $$\mathbf{v}(\text{king}) - \mathbf{v}(\text{man}) + \mathbf{v}(\text{woman}) \approx \mathbf{v}(\text{queen})$$

    where $\mathbf{v}(w)$ denotes the embedding vector for word $w$.

The fact that this linear combination of word vectors yields another word vector (specifically, one close to "queen") demonstrates the semantic structure captured in the vector space. This analogical reasoning using addition/subtraction is possible because the embedding vectors live in a high-dimensional vector space that respects linear relationships.

#### üß† Deep Learning Frameworks and Vector Operations

!!! info "üîß Framework Implementation"
    In deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, vectors are typically represented as arrays (tensors) of numbers, and all operations follow linear algebra rules. The vector space axioms are implicitly honored by these frameworks:

    - **Closure under addition:** Adding two tensors of the same shape yields another tensor of that shape
    - **Closure under scalar multiplication:** Multiplying a tensor by a scalar yields another tensor

```python
import torch

# Define three example 3-dimensional vectors (PyTorch tensors)
u = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v = torch.tensor([-4.0, 5.0, 0.5])
w = torch.tensor([2.0, -3.0, 1.0])

# Verify vector space axioms
print("=== Vector Space Axiom Verification ===")

# Commutativity of addition: u + v == v + u
print(f"Commutativity: {torch.allclose(u + v, v + u)}")

# Additive identity: u + 0 = u
zero_vec = torch.zeros(3)
print(f"Additive identity: {torch.allclose(u + zero_vec, u)}")

# Additive inverse: u + (-u) = 0
print(f"Additive inverse: {torch.allclose(u + (-1)*u, zero_vec)}")

# Associativity of addition: (u+v)+w == u+(v+w)
print(f"Associativity: {torch.allclose((u + v) + w, u + (v + w))}")

# Distributivity: a*(u+v) == a*u + a*v
a = 3.5
print(f"Distributivity: {torch.allclose(a * (u + v), a * u + a * v)}")
```

!!! note "üß† Neural Network Applications"
    These vector space properties enable linear operations in neural networks:

    - **Layer computation**: $\mathbf{y} = W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ (linear combination)
    - **Gradient descent**: Vector addition in parameter space
    - **Backpropagation**: Linear combinations of gradients

    The correctness of these operations relies on vectors living in well-defined vector spaces where addition and scalar multiplication are valid.

## 1.4 Superposition in Vector Spaces

!!! example "üß† Superposition Theory (Anthropic, 2022-2024)"
    **Key Insight**: Neural networks can represent more features than dimensions through **superposition** - features correspond to directions in activation space that aren't necessarily orthogonal.

!!! note "üìê Mathematical Framework"
    In traditional linear algebra, we often assume features correspond to orthogonal basis vectors. However, neural networks can represent $n$ features in $m < n$ dimensions through superposition:

    $$
    \text{Feature representation: } \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mathbf{f}_i
    $$

    where $\mathbf{f}_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ are **non-orthogonal** feature directions and $n > m$.

=== "Superposition Conditions"
    **Sparsity Requirement**: For superposition to work effectively:

    $$
    \mathbb{E}[|\{i : a_i \neq 0\}|] \ll n
    $$

    Most features must be inactive most of the time, allowing interference patterns to be manageable.

=== "Interference Patterns"
    **Feature Interference**: When multiple features are active simultaneously:

    $$
    \text{Interference} = \sum_{i \neq j} a_i a_j \langle \mathbf{f}_i, \mathbf{f}_j \rangle
    $$

    Non-orthogonal features create interference, but sparse activation minimizes this effect.

=== "LLM Applications"
    **Practical Implications**:
    - **Token representations**: Single vectors encode multiple semantic features
    - **Attention patterns**: Multiple concepts can be attended to simultaneously
    - **Interpretability**: Understanding which features are represented in superposition

!!! tip "üîç Research Applications"
    Recent work by Anthropic demonstrates that transformer models extensively use superposition to pack more semantic information into fixed-dimensional representations, explaining why larger models can capture more nuanced relationships despite linear scaling of parameters.

## 2. Vector Subspaces and Their Properties

!!! abstract "üîë Key Concept: Vector Subspace"
    A **subspace** is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations. Think of it as a "smaller" vector space living inside a larger one.

### 2.1 Subspace Definitions and the Subspace Test

A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space (under the same operations). More precisely, if $(V, +, \cdot)$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then a subset $W \subseteq V$ is called a vector subspace of $V$ if:

1. $W$ is non-empty
2. $W$ is **closed under addition**: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in W$ for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in W$
3. $W$ is **closed under scalar multiplication**: $a\mathbf{u} \in W$ for all $\mathbf{u} \in W$ and scalars $a \in F$

!!! tip "‚úÖ The Subspace Test"
    **Simplified Test**: A non-empty subset $W \subseteq V$ is a subspace if and only if for any vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in W$ and any scalars $a, b$:

    $$a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{v} \in W$$

    This single condition encapsulates both closure properties:

    - Setting $a=b=1$: closure under addition
    - Setting $b=0$: closure under scalar multiplication
    - Setting $a=1, b=-1$: guarantees zero vector is in $W$

The beauty of this test is that we don't need to verify all ten vector space axioms ‚Äì the other properties are automatically inherited from the parent space $V$.

### Key Properties of Subspaces

!!! note "üìä Essential Subspace Properties"
    Any subspace $W$ of vector space $V$ has these fundamental properties:

    **1. Contains Zero Vector**

    - $\mathbf{0} \in W$ (since $\mathbf{0} = 0\mathbf{u}$ for any $\mathbf{u} \in W$)

    **2. Closure Properties**

    - Closed under addition: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in W$ for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in W$
    - Closed under scalar multiplication: $a\mathbf{u} \in W$ for all $\mathbf{u} \in W$, $a \in F$

    **3. Inherits Vector Space Structure**

    - $W$ is itself a vector space with operations restricted from $V$
    - All ten axioms automatically satisfied

    **4. Intersection vs Union Behavior**

    - ‚úÖ **Intersection**: $U \cap W$ is always a subspace
    - ‚ùå **Union**: $U \cup W$ is generally NOT a subspace

!!! warning "‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfall: Union of Subspaces"
    The union of two subspaces is usually **not** a subspace!

    **Example**: In $\mathbb{R}^2$, let $U$ = x-axis and $W$ = y-axis. Both are subspaces, but:

    - $\mathbf{u} = (1,0) \in U$ and $\mathbf{w} = (0,1) \in W$
    - $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w} = (1,1) \notin U \cup W$

    The union fails closure under addition!

### Examples of Subspaces

Subspaces appear in many forms. Intuitively, subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are flat geometric objects through the origin (lines, planes, etc. through the origin). Here are some examples:

1. **In $\mathbb{R}^3$, any line through the origin** is a one-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$. For instance, $W = \{ t(1,2,3) : t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ (a line through $(1,2,3)$). It contains $0=(0,0,0)$ (when $t=0$) and is closed under addition/scaling (adding two multiples of $(1,2,3)$ yields another multiple of $(1,2,3)$).

2. **In $\mathbb{R}^3$, any plane through the origin** is a two-dimensional subspace. For example, $W = \{(x,y,0) : x,y \in \mathbb{R}\}$ (the $xy$-plane) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$. It contains $(0,0,0)$, and adding or scaling vectors that have zero $z$-component keeps the $z$-component zero.

3. **Solution sets of homogeneous linear equations:** If $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ is a homogeneous linear system, the set of all solutions $\{\mathbf{x}: A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (where $n$ is the number of columns of $A$). This set is called the null space (or kernel) of $A$. It is a subspace because $A(c_1\mathbf{x}_1 + c_2\mathbf{x}_2) = c_1A\mathbf{x}_1 + c_2A\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{0}$ for any two solutions $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2$ and scalars $c_1,c_2$, so any linear combination of solutions is still a solution.

4. **Column spaces and Row spaces:** The set of all linear combinations of the columns of a matrix $A$ (the column space of $A$) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ (if $A$ is $m\times n$). Similarly, the row space (all linear combinations of row vectors) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. These subspaces are fundamental in linear algebra (relating to the rank of $A$).

5. **Polynomial subspaces:** Consider $V$ = all polynomials, and let $W$ = all polynomials of degree $\leq k$. $W$ is a subspace of $V$. It's closed under addition and scaling (adding two polynomials of degree at most $k$ yields at most degree $k$, etc.). Another example: the set of all even functions (or odd functions) is a subspace of the vector space of all real functions, since the sum of even functions is even, etc.

### Subspaces in Machine Learning

In ML and data science, subspaces often correspond to certain feature subspaces or latent spaces. For example, in PCA (Principal Component Analysis), we find a low-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that captures most variance of the data. The top $k$ principal components span a $k$-dimensional subspace (the principal subspace); projecting data onto this subspace reduces dimensionality while preserving key structure. In deep learning, the concept of a latent space (e.g. the space of encoded features in an autoencoder) is essentially a vector space, and sometimes we constrain it to a subspace for regularization (e.g. requiring certain features to be zero ‚Äì effectively confining data to a subspace). The column space example above has a direct analog: the column space of a network layer's weight matrix is the subspace of outputs that the layer can produce (since any output is $W\mathbf{x}$ for some input $\mathbf{x}$, and thus lies in the span of the columns of $W$). Understanding subspaces can help in analyzing model capacity: for instance, if a model's weight matrices have rank deficiency, the outputs lie in a lower-dimensional subspace of the target space, potentially limiting expressiveness.

To illustrate a simple subspace situation in code, consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ and two subspaces: $U =$ x-axis (all vectors of the form $(x,0)$) and $W =$ y-axis (all vectors of the form $(0,y)$). Both $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^2$. However, their union $U \cup W$ (all vectors that lie on either the x-axis or y-axis) is not a subspace because it's not closed under addition. For example, $\mathbf{u}=(1,0)\in U$ and $\mathbf{w}=(0,1)\in W$, but $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{w}=(1,1)$ is not in $U \cup W$ (it's not on either axis). We can check this with a short snippet:

```python
# Define x-axis subspace U and y-axis subspace W in R^2
def in_U(v):  # check if v is on x-axis
    return v[1] == 0

def in_W(v):  # check if v is on y-axis
    return v[0] == 0

u = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0])
w = torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0])
sum_vec = u + w

print(in_U(u) and in_U(w))      # True, True (u and w individually lie in U or W respectively)
print(in_U(sum_vec), in_W(sum_vec))  # False, False -> sum_vec = (1,1) is in neither U nor W
```

This prints True, True for the first line (meaning $u \in U$ and $w \in W$ individually) and False, False for the second (meaning $(1,1)$ is in neither $U$ nor $W$), confirming the union is not closed under addition. In contrast, the intersection $U \cap W$ in this case is $\{\mathbf{0}\}$, which is a subspace (the trivial subspace). This simple exercise shows the importance of the closure property in defining subspaces.

## Intersections and Sums of Subspaces

When dealing with multiple subspaces, two fundamental operations are their intersection and their sum. We touched on intersections above; here we formalize and explore these concepts further.

### Intersection of Subspaces

If $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$, then $U \cap W = \{\mathbf{v} : \mathbf{v} \in U \text{ and } \mathbf{v} \in W\}$ is also a subspace of $V$. The intersection is at least $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ (since $0$ lies in every subspace) and possibly larger if $U$ and $W$ have other vectors in common. The intersection $U \cap W$ satisfies the subspace test: if $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$ are in both $U$ and $W$, then $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}$ is in both $U$ and $W$ (since each is a subspace), hence in the intersection; similarly for scalar multiples. In general, the intersection $U \cap W$ is the largest subspace contained in both $U$ and $W$. For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if $U$ is the $xy$-plane and $W$ is the $xz$-plane, then $U \cap W$ is the $x$-axis (their line of intersection), which indeed is a subspace (1-dimensional line) common to both. If two subspaces have only the zero vector in common (their intersection is $\{0\}$), we say they intersect trivially. This situation is especially important for direct sums (discussed in the next section).

### Sum of Subspaces

Given two subspaces $U, W \subseteq V$, their sum is defined as

$$U + W = \{ \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w} : \mathbf{u} \in U, \mathbf{w} \in W \}$$

In words, $U+W$ consists of all vectors you can form by adding one vector from $U$ and one from $W$. It's not a disjoint union, but rather all possible sums of one element from each. $U+W$ is itself a subspace of $V$. To see this, consider any two vectors in $U+W$: say $\mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{u}_1 + \mathbf{w}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{u}_2 + \mathbf{w}_2$ with $\mathbf{u}_i \in U, \mathbf{w}_i \in W$. Their sum is $\mathbf{v}_1+\mathbf{v}_2 = (\mathbf{u}_1+\mathbf{u}_2)+(\mathbf{w}_1+\mathbf{w}_2)$. Since $U$ and $W$ are subspaces, $\mathbf{u}_1+\mathbf{u}_2 \in U$ and $\mathbf{w}_1+\mathbf{w}_2 \in W$. Thus $\mathbf{v}_1+\mathbf{v}_2$ is still of the form (something in $U$) + (something in $W$), hence in $U+W$. Similarly, for a scalar $a$, $a\mathbf{v}_1 = (a\mathbf{u}_1) + (a\mathbf{w}_1) \in U+W$. The zero vector is $0+0 \in U+W$. So $U+W$ satisfies the subspace criteria.

Geometrically, $U+W$ can be thought of as the smallest subspace of $V$ that contains both $U$ and $W$. Indeed, any subspace containing $U$ and $W$ must contain all their sums and scalar multiples, so it must contain $U+W$. For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if $U$ is a line along the $x$-axis and $W$ is a line along the $y$-axis, then $U+W$ is the $xy$-plane (all vectors of the form $(a,b,0)$). That plane is the smallest subspace containing both lines. If instead $W$ were the $xy$-plane and $U$ the $x$-axis (which lies within $W$), then $U+W = W$ (summing doesn't go beyond the larger subspace in that case). More generally, if $U \subseteq W$, then $U+W = W$. At the other extreme, if $U$ and $W$ share only the zero vector (no other overlap), the dimension of $U+W$ is $\dim(U) + \dim(W)$ (for finite dimensions), since their sum basically puts the subspaces "together" as direct summands (we formalize this as the direct sum soon).

### Generalization

One can define the sum of multiple subspaces $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_k \subseteq V$ as

$$U_1 + U_2 + \cdots + U_k = \{\mathbf{u}_1 + \mathbf{u}_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{u}_k : \mathbf{u}_i \in U_i \text{ for each } i\}$$

This is also a subspace of $V$. For instance, $U_1+U_2+U_3$ is the set of all sums of one vector from each $U_i$. The same closure argument extends by induction. Often, the notation $\sum_{i=1}^k U_i$ is used for this subspace. In practical terms, if each $U_i$ is spanned by some basis, then $U_1+\cdots+U_k$ is spanned by the union of all those basis vectors.

### Relationship between Dimension, Sum, and Intersection

For finite-dimensional spaces, there is an important formula called **Grassmann's dimension formula**:

$$\dim(U+W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W)$$

This formula reflects that if $U$ and $W$ overlap (non-trivial intersection), we count that overlap once when summing dimensions. If $U$ and $W$ only intersect trivially ($U \cap W = \{0\}$), then $\dim(U+W) = \dim(U)+\dim(W)$. In the previous example, $\dim(x\text{-axis})=1$, $\dim(y\text{-axis})=1$, and $\dim$(their intersection$)=0$, so $\dim(xy\text{-plane}) = 1+1-0 = 2$, which checks out.

### Application in Machine Learning

While we rarely speak explicitly about "sums of subspaces" in applied ML, the concept appears when combining feature sets or learned representations. For instance, consider a scenario with multiple sets of features (say visual features and textual features for an image captioning system). One approach to combine them is to concatenate feature vectors (which corresponds to a direct product of vector spaces), but another approach is to project them into a common vector space and then add them. When we add two feature vectors (one from subspace $U$ of visual features, one from subspace $W$ of textual features), the result lies in $U+W$. In neural networks, skip connections or residual connections effectively add vectors coming from different subspaces (e.g. the output of a previous layer with the output of a deeper layer) ‚Äì the result lives in the sum of those subspaces. If those subspaces carry complementary information, the sum has richer representation power. In attention mechanisms, it's common to sum positional encodings and word embeddings. Suppose $U$ is the subspace spanned by positional encoding vectors and $W$ is the subspace spanned by token embedding vectors. Individual position or token embeddings lie in $U$ or $W$ respectively, and the combined input embedding is a sum $\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{t}$ with $\mathbf{p}\in U$, $\mathbf{t}\in W$. This sum resides in $U+W$. If $U$ and $W$ overlap minimally (ideally only at $\{0\}$), the model can disentangle content and positional information. In practice, learned embeddings may not be strictly confined to separate subspaces, but the idea of combining different representation subspaces via addition is powerful (and designers try to ensure one doesn't dominate or distort the other, e.g. by scaling).

## Direct Sums of Subspaces

The direct sum is a special case of the sum of subspaces where the intersection is trivial. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are subspaces of $V$. We say $V$ is the direct sum of $X$ and $Y$ if every vector in $V$ can be expressed uniquely as the sum of a vector from $X$ and a vector from $Y$. In notation, we write:

$$V = X \oplus Y$$

This definition encompasses two conditions:

1. **Spanning (Sum) Condition:** Every $v \in V$ can be written as $v = x + y$ with $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. (So $X+Y = V$ in terms of set equality, i.e. the sum of the subspaces covers the whole space $V$.)

2. **Uniqueness Condition:** This representation is unique; no vector in $V$ has two different such $X+Y$ decompositions. Equivalently, the only way to write $0$ as $x+y$ with $x \in X, y \in Y$ is the trivial way $x=0, y=0$.

These two conditions together imply that $X \cap Y = \{\mathbf{0}\}$. In fact, it can be shown that $V = X \oplus Y$ if and only if $V = X + Y$ and $X \cap Y = \{0\}$. The "if" part is straightforward: if $X+Y=V$ and they only intersect at $0$, take any $v\in V$; it has at least one decomposition $v=x+y$. If there were another $v=x'+y'$, subtracting gives $0 = (x-x') + (y-y')$ with $x-x' \in X$ and $y-y' \in Y$. By uniqueness, this forces $x-x'=0$ and $y-y'=0$, so $x=x', y=y'$, proving uniqueness. Conversely, if decomposition is unique, in particular $0$ can only decompose as $0+0$, implying no non-zero vector can be in both $X$ and $Y$ (so intersection is $\{0\}$); and certainly $X+Y$ must equal $V$ by the assumption that every vector can be expressed as such a sum.

The notion extends to more than two subspaces: We say $V = U_1 \oplus U_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus U_k$ if (1) $V = U_1 + U_2 + \cdots + U_k$ and (2) the intersection of any subcollection of the $U_i$'s is trivial (equivalently, the uniqueness of representing any vector as a sum of vectors from each $U_i$ holds). In practice, a simple criterion for a direct sum of multiple subspaces is that no nontrivial linear combination of vectors from different subspaces can yield zero except the trivial combination.

When $V$ is a direct sum of subspaces $X$ and $Y$, we sometimes call $X$ and $Y$ complementary subspaces. Each element of $V$ can be split into an $X$-part and a $Y$-part in a unique way. A classic example: in $\mathbb{R}^2$, let $X$ be the $x$-axis and $Y$ be the $y$-axis. Then indeed $\mathbb{R}^2 = X \oplus Y$ because any vector $(a,b)$ can be uniquely written as $(a,0)+(0,b)$ with $(a,0)\in X$ and $(0,b)\in Y$. The intersection $X \cap Y = \{\mathbf{0}\}$ (only the origin lies on both the $x$- and $y$-axes). If we had chosen $Y$ to be another line through the origin that is not the $y$-axis, say $Y$ is the line spanned by $(1,1)$, then $X \cap Y = \{0\}$ still (the $x$-axis and the line $y=x$ intersect only at $(0,0)$). Is $\mathbb{R}^2 = X \oplus Y$ in that case? Yes, because $(1,1)$ is not a multiple of $(1,0)$, so together those two directions span $\mathbb{R}^2$ and any $(a,b)$ has a unique decomposition $(a,b) = (c,0) + (d,d)$ for suitable $c,d$. If instead we chose $Y$ to be the line spanned by $(2,0)$, that would not give a direct sum decomposition with $X$ since $Y$ is actually the same subspace as $X$ (just a different basis vector for it), and $X \cap Y = X$ in that degenerate case (not trivial). There would be infinitely many ways to write a vector on the $x$-axis as $x + y$ with $x\in X, y\in Y$ because those are essentially the same subspace.

### Criterion for Direct Sum

**Criterion (for two subspaces):** $V = X \oplus Y$ if and only if $X+Y=V$ and $X \cap Y = \{0\}$. Often, it's easy to check $X+Y = V$ (span condition) and $X \cap Y = \{0\}$ (independence condition) to conclude a direct sum. In terms of dimensions, if $V = X \oplus Y$ in finite dimensions, then $\dim(V) = \dim(X) + \dim(Y)$ (since none of the dimension of $X$ is "wasted" in overlapping with $Y$). Conversely, if $\dim(X)+\dim(Y)=\dim(X+Y)$, it implies $X \cap Y$ must be trivial, hence $X+Y$ is direct.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Decomposing $\mathbb{R}^n$ into complementary subspaces. Consider $X=\{(x,0,0,\ldots,0)\}$ the $x_1$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $Y=\{(0,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_n)\}$ the subspace of vectors with first coordinate $0$. Then $X \cap Y = \{\mathbf{0}\}$ and $X+Y = \mathbb{R}^n$ (any vector splits into its first-coordinate part plus the rest). So $\mathbb{R}^n = X \oplus Y$. Here $Y = (\text{span of basis }e_2,\ldots,e_n)$ can be viewed as a complement of $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (and vice versa, $X$ is a complement of $Y$).

**Example 2:** Direct sum in matrix spaces. The space of all $n\times n$ real matrices, denoted $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$, can be seen as the direct sum of two subspaces: $S =$ the space of symmetric matrices and $A =$ the space of skew-symmetric (anti-symmetric) matrices. Any matrix $M$ can be uniquely written as $M = S + A$ where $S = \frac{1}{2}(M + M^T)$ is symmetric and $A = \frac{1}{2}(M - M^T)$ is skew-symmetric. We have $M_{n}(\mathbb{R}) = S \oplus A$. Indeed, $S \cap A = \{\mathbf{0}\}$ (the only matrix that is both symmetric and skew-symmetric is the zero matrix), and clearly $S + A$ gives all matrices (by the formula above, every matrix is the sum of one symmetric and one skew matrix). This is a powerful decomposition in linear algebra and has practical uses (e.g. any square matrix's even and odd parts under transpose). The uniqueness of the decomposition is evident from the formula ‚Äì it's essentially the projection onto symmetric vs skew components.

**Example 3:** Direct sum of more than two subspaces. Consider $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $U_1 = \text{span}\{(1,0,0)\}$ (the $x$-axis), $U_2 = \text{span}\{(0,1,0)\}$ (the $y$-axis), and $U_3 = \text{span}\{(0,0,1)\}$ (the $z$-axis). Then $\mathbb{R}^3 = U_1 \oplus U_2 \oplus U_3$, since any vector $(a,b,c)$ decomposes uniquely as $(a,0,0)+(0,b,0)+(0,0,c)$. All pairwise intersections are trivial (each pair of axes only meet at the origin). This extends the idea of coordinate axes providing a direct sum decomposition of the space (which is essentially what a basis does). In general, if $\{\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_n\}$ is a basis of $V$, and we let $U_i = \text{span}\{\mathbf{v}_i\}$ (the one-dimensional subspace generated by $\mathbf{v}_i$), then $V = U_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus U_n$.

### Direct Sums in Machine Learning

The concept of a direct sum appears in ML primarily in how we design or interpret model architectures. One prominent example is multi-head attention in Transformers. The embedding vector (of dimension $d_{\text{model}}$) is often split into $h$ smaller vectors of dimension $d_k = d_{\text{model}}/h$ for the $h$ attention heads. In implementation, these heads operate on different sections of the embedding. We can think of the model's embedding space as partitioned into $h$ subspaces, each subspace corresponding to one head's portion of the vector (this is a simplification, since in practice they use learned linear projections, but conceptually similar). The multi-head attention mechanism projects the input into multiple smaller subspaces and each head focuses on one subspace. Essentially, the embedding vector gets "segmented" into parts that live in different representational subspaces. If we assume these subspaces intersect only at $\{0\}$ (which is ideal, since we want each head to capture distinct aspects of the representation), then the full embedding can be seen as a direct sum of the head subspaces. After processing, the outputs of each head are concatenated (or added) back together, which corresponds to recombining those subspace components. This idea is why it's said that multi-head attention allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces in parallel. In simpler terms, each head handles a different part of the feature space, and together they cover the whole space (direct sum decomposition of the feature space).

Another application: sometimes architectures explicitly split an intermediate vector into parts and process them differently. For example, one could split a hidden state vector into two halves, use one half for one purpose and the other half for another, then combine results. By design, those two halves span complementary subspaces of the state space. This is conceptually a direct sum: the hidden state space $V$ is regarded as $V = V_{\text{part1}} \oplus V_{\text{part2}}$. As long as the network ensures those parts don't interfere (no overlapping information unless intended), analysis can treat them separately. This is akin to how, in an RNN, one might manually partition the state vector for different tasks (though more often the partition emerges from training rather than a hard constraint).

To cement understanding, let's do a brief code example demonstrating a direct sum decomposition in a simple case. Consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ with subspace $X = \text{span}\{(1,1)\}$ and subspace $Y = \text{span}\{(1,-1)\}$. These are two distinct lines through the origin. Their intersection $X \cap Y = \{0\}$ (no nonzero vector lies on both lines). Any vector $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be uniquely written as $(a,b) = x + y$ with $x \in X, y \in Y$. In fact, one can solve for such a decomposition: find scalars $c,d$ such that

$$c(1,1) + d(1,-1) = (a,b)$$

This yields a linear system:

$$(c+d, c-d) = (a, b)$$

so $c+d = a$ and $c-d = b$. Solving gives $c = \frac{a+b}{2}$ and $d = \frac{a-b}{2}$. These are unique, confirming the direct sum. Let's verify with code for a random vector and also see what happens if we choose subspaces that are not direct complements:

```python
import torch
# Define basis vectors for subspaces X and Y in R^2
e1 = torch.tensor([1.0, 1.0])    # basis for X
e2 = torch.tensor([1.0, -1.0])   # basis for Y

# Random vector in R^2
v = torch.randn(2)  # e.g., [a, b]

# Solve for coefficients c,d such that c*e1 + d*e2 = v
A = torch.stack([e1, e2], dim=1)  # form 2x2 matrix with e1,e2 as columns
coeffs = torch.linalg.solve(A, v)  # solve A * [c; d] = v
c, d = coeffs.tolist()
print("v:", v.tolist())
print("c and d:", c, d)

# Reconstruct v from c*e1 + d*e2
reconstructed = c*e1 + d*e2
print("c*e1 + d*e2:", reconstructed.tolist())

# Now try a case where subspaces are not complementary
f1 = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0])  # basis for U (x-axis)
f2 = torch.tensor([2.0, 0.0])  # basis for W (points on x-axis too, essentially same line)
B = torch.stack([f1, f2], dim=1)
try:
    coeffs = torch.linalg.solve(B, v)  # this will fail as B is singular (f1,f2 not independent)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Solving failed for non-complementary subspaces (expected, they're not independent).")
```

In the first part, we form matrix $A = [e_1 \; e_2]$ and solve $A \begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix} = v$. For example, if $v=(2,0)$, the solution will yield $c=1, d=1$ (since $1*(1,1)+1*(1,-1)=(2,0)$). The output will show that the reconstructed vector matches $v$ exactly. In the second part, we attempt the same with $U=\text{span}\{(1,0)\}$ and $W=\text{span}\{(2,0)\}$. Here $W$ is not adding a new dimension (it's the same line as $U$), so $U+W$ is just that line, not all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. The matrix $B$ constructed from $(1,0)$ and $(2,0)$ as columns is rank-deficient (not invertible), and `torch.linalg.solve` will throw an error, indicating no unique solution (indeed, if $v=(2,0)$, there are infinitely many solutions like $v = (2,0)+ (0,0)$ or $v=(1,0)+(1,0)$, etc., and if $v$ had any non-zero second component, no solution at all). This aligns with the failure of direct sum conditions ‚Äì $U \cap W$ is not $\{0\}$ but $U$ itself in this degenerate case, and $U+W \neq \mathbb{R}^2$.

### 2.4 Direct Sums and Multimodal Representations

!!! example "üé≠ Multimodal Learning Applications"
    Direct sums provide a mathematical framework for understanding how modern AI systems combine different types of information (text, images, audio) in a unified representation space.

!!! note "üìê Mathematical Framework for Multimodal Fusion"
    **Direct Sum Decomposition**: In multimodal learning, we often want to combine representations from different modalities:

    $$
    \mathbf{h}_{\text{combined}} = \mathbf{h}_{\text{text}} \oplus \mathbf{h}_{\text{image}} \oplus \mathbf{h}_{\text{audio}}
    $$

    where each $\mathbf{h}_{\text{modality}}$ lives in its own subspace.

=== "Concatenation vs. Direct Sum"
    **Concatenation Approach**:

    $$
    \mathbf{h} = [\mathbf{h}_{\text{text}}; \mathbf{h}_{\text{image}}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 + d_2}
    $$

    **Direct Sum Approach**:

    $$
    \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{h}_{\text{text}} + \mathbf{h}_{\text{image}} \in \mathbb{R}^d
    $$

    where both modalities are projected to the same dimension $d$.

=== "Advantages of Direct Sum Structure"
    **Benefits**:

    1. **Dimension efficiency**: No increase in representation size
    2. **Modality independence**: Each modality can be processed separately
    3. **Interpretability**: Easy to isolate contributions from each modality
    4. **Computational efficiency**: Parallel processing of modalities

!!! tip "üî¨ Research Applications"
    **CLIP and Multimodal Models**: Modern vision-language models like CLIP use direct sum-like structures where:

    - Text and image encoders project to the same embedding space
    - Similarity is computed in this shared space
    - Each modality maintains its distinct subspace properties

    **Mathematical Insight**: The success of CLIP demonstrates that different modalities can be effectively combined when their representations form complementary subspaces of a larger space.

## 3. Linear Independence and Basis

!!! abstract "üîë Key Concept: Linear Independence"
    A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. This concept is fundamental to understanding the structure and dimensionality of vector spaces.

### 3.1 Linear Independence and Spanning Sets

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Linear Independence"
    Vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ are **linearly independent** if the only solution to:

    $$c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0}$$

    is $c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_k = 0$ (the trivial solution).

    If there exists a non-trivial solution (at least one $c_i \neq 0$), the vectors are **linearly dependent**.

!!! example "üîç Geometric Interpretation"

    === "In $\mathbb{R}^2$"
        - Two vectors are linearly independent if they don't lie on the same line through the origin
        - Example: $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ are linearly independent
        - Example: $(1,2)$ and $(2,4)$ are linearly dependent (one is a scalar multiple of the other)

    === "In $\mathbb{R}^3$"
        - Three vectors are linearly independent if they don't lie in the same plane through the origin
        - Example: $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ are linearly independent
        - Any four vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are automatically linearly dependent

!!! tip "üß† LLM Application: Token Embeddings"
    In language models, linearly independent embedding vectors represent distinct semantic concepts. If word embeddings were linearly dependent, some words would be redundant representations of others, reducing the model's expressive power.

    **Recent Research Insight**: According to Anthropic's "Toy Models of Superposition" (2022), neural networks can represent more features than dimensions through **superposition** - a phenomenon where features correspond to directions in activation space that aren't necessarily orthogonal. This challenges traditional linear independence assumptions in high-dimensional embedding spaces.

### 3.2 Basis and Dimension

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Basis"
    A **basis** for a vector space $V$ is a set of vectors that:

    1. **Spans** $V$ (every vector in $V$ can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors)
    2. Is **linearly independent**

    The **dimension** of $V$ is the number of vectors in any basis of $V$.

!!! example "üî¢ Standard Bases"

    === "Standard Basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$"
        The standard basis vectors are:

        $$\mathbf{e}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{e}_2 = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\\vdots\\1\end{pmatrix}$$

        Any vector $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)$ can be written as:

        $$\mathbf{v} = v_1\mathbf{e}_1 + v_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \cdots + v_n\mathbf{e}_n$$

    === "Polynomial Basis"
        For polynomials of degree ‚â§ 2: $\{1, x, x^2\}$ forms a basis

        Any quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a linear combination:

        $$p(x) = c \cdot 1 + b \cdot x + a \cdot x^2$$

### 3.3 Applications in Neural Network Design

!!! example "ü§ñ Neural Network Applications"

    === "Hidden Layer Representations"
        Each hidden layer in a neural network can be viewed as learning a basis for representing the input data in a new coordinate system. The weight matrix $W$ defines a linear transformation that maps inputs to this new basis.

    === "Attention Mechanisms"
        In transformer models, the query, key, and value matrices ($W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$) learn different bases for projecting the input embeddings. These projections allow the model to attend to different aspects of the input.

        **Research Finding**: Multi-head attention can be viewed as learning multiple orthogonal subspaces, where each head captures different types of relationships in the data.

    === "Dimensionality and Model Capacity"
        The rank of weight matrices determines the effective dimensionality of the learned representations. A full-rank matrix preserves all information, while a low-rank matrix creates a bottleneck that forces the model to learn compressed representations.

        **Practical Insight**: Recent work on batch normalization shows that it tends to orthogonalize representations in deep networks, effectively creating more independent basis vectors for better learning dynamics.

!!! tip "üí° Practical Insight"
    **Rank Deficiency in Neural Networks**: When weight matrices have reduced rank (fewer linearly independent columns), the model's representational capacity is limited. This can be:

    - **Beneficial**: Acts as regularization, preventing overfitting
    - **Detrimental**: Limits the model's ability to capture complex patterns

### 3.4 Superposition Theory and Feature Representation

!!! example "üß† Advanced Superposition in Neural Networks"
    Building on the mathematical framework from Section 1.4, we explore how superposition affects basis selection and feature representation in large language models.

!!! note "üìä Superposition vs. Traditional Basis Concepts"
    **Traditional View**: Features correspond to orthogonal basis vectors

    $$
    \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} a_i \mathbf{e}_i \quad \text{where } \langle \mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}
    $$

    **Superposition View**: Features can be non-orthogonal directions

    $$
    \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mathbf{f}_i \quad \text{where } n > d \text{ and } \mathbf{f}_i \text{ not orthogonal}
    $$

=== "Basis Selection in Superposition"
    **Optimal Feature Directions**: The choice of feature directions $\mathbf{f}_i$ depends on:

    - **Feature frequency**: More common features get directions closer to basis vectors
    - **Feature importance**: Critical features receive less interference
    - **Sparsity patterns**: Features that rarely co-occur can share similar directions

    $$
    \mathbf{f}_i = \arg\min_{\mathbf{f}} \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j \neq i} a_i a_j \langle \mathbf{f}, \mathbf{f}_j \rangle^2\right]
    $$

=== "Dimensionality and Capacity"
    **Superposition Capacity**: The number of features that can be represented scales with:

    $$
    n \approx \frac{d}{\text{sparsity}} \cdot \log(\text{tolerance})
    $$

    where sparsity is the fraction of active features and tolerance is acceptable interference.

!!! tip "üî¨ Experimental Evidence"
    Recent research shows that in transformer models:

    - **GPT-2 small**: Can represent ~10x more features than embedding dimensions
    - **Larger models**: Show even higher superposition ratios
    - **Attention heads**: Each head uses superposition differently for different types of features

## 4. Linear Transformations and Matrices

!!! abstract "üîë Key Concept: Linear Transformation"
    A **linear transformation** is a function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. In machine learning, these transformations are the building blocks of neural networks.

### 4.1 Linear Transformations

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Linear Transformation"
    A function $T: V \to W$ between vector spaces is **linear** if for all vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$ and scalars $a, b$:

    $$T(a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{v}) = aT(\mathbf{u}) + bT(\mathbf{v})$$

    This single condition encapsulates two properties:

    - **Additivity**: $T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})$
    - **Homogeneity**: $T(a\mathbf{v}) = aT(\mathbf{v})$

!!! example "üîç Common Linear Transformations"

    === "Scaling"
        $T(\mathbf{x}) = a\mathbf{x}$ for some scalar $a$

        - Stretches or shrinks vectors by factor $a$
        - Used in neural networks for feature scaling

    === "Rotation"
        In $\mathbb{R}^2$, rotation by angle $\theta$:

        $$T\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta\\\sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$$

    === "Projection"
        Orthogonal projection onto a subspace

        - Used in PCA for dimensionality reduction
        - Foundation of attention mechanisms

### 4.2 Matrix Representations

!!! tip "üîó Matrix-Transformation Connection"
    Every linear transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented by a matrix. If $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, then there exists an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ such that:

    $$T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$$

!!! example "üßÆ Neural Network Layers as Linear Transformations"

    === "Dense/Fully Connected Layer"
        A dense layer with weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and bias $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$:

        $$\mathbf{y} = W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$$

        The linear part $W\mathbf{x}$ is a linear transformation from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$.

    === "Convolutional Layer"
        Convolution can be viewed as a linear transformation where the matrix has a special structure (Toeplitz matrix with shared weights).

    === "Attention Mechanism"
        Query, key, and value projections are linear transformations:

        $$Q = XW_Q, \quad K = XW_K, \quad V = XW_V$$

### 4.3 Composition and Inverse Transformations

!!! note "üîÑ Composition of Linear Transformations"
    If $T_1: U \to V$ and $T_2: V \to W$ are linear transformations, their composition $T_2 \circ T_1: U \to W$ is also linear:

    $$(T_2 \circ T_1)(\mathbf{x}) = T_2(T_1(\mathbf{x}))$$

    In matrix form: $(T_2 \circ T_1)$ is represented by $A_2A_1$ where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the matrices for $T_1$ and $T_2$.

!!! example "üß† Deep Networks as Composed Transformations"
    A deep neural network is a composition of linear transformations and nonlinear activation functions:

    $$\mathbf{y} = f_L(W_L f_{L-1}(W_{L-1} \cdots f_1(W_1\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1) \cdots + \mathbf{b}_{L-1}) + \mathbf{b}_L)$$

    Each $W_i\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_i$ is an affine transformation (linear transformation plus translation).

    **Mathematical Insight**: The composition of linear transformations is itself linear, but the nonlinear activations break this linearity, allowing neural networks to approximate any continuous function (universal approximation theorem).

!!! warning "‚ö†Ô∏è Invertibility and Information Preservation"
    A linear transformation $T$ is **invertible** if there exists $T^{-1}$ such that $T^{-1}(T(\mathbf{x})) = \mathbf{x}$.

    - **Matrix condition**: $T$ is invertible ‚ü∫ its matrix representation is invertible (full rank)
    - **ML implication**: Invertible layers preserve all information, while non-invertible layers create information bottlenecks

### 4.4 Advanced Low-Rank Methods in LLMs

!!! example "üîß Modern LoRA Variants (2024-2025)"
    Recent advances in low-rank adaptation have revolutionized fine-tuning of large language models, building on fundamental linear algebra concepts of rank and matrix decomposition.

!!! note "üìê Mathematical Foundation of Low-Rank Adaptation"
    **Core Principle**: Instead of updating the full weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, we approximate the update with a low-rank decomposition:

    $$
    W' = W + \Delta W = W + BA
    $$

    where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$, and $r \ll \min(d,k)$.

=== "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)"
    **Standard LoRA**: The foundational approach

    $$
    h = W_0 x + \Delta W x = W_0 x + BAx
    $$

    - **Parameters**: Reduces from $dk$ to $r(d+k)$ parameters
    - **Rank constraint**: $\text{rank}(\Delta W) \leq r$
    - **Efficiency**: Significant memory and computational savings

=== "DoRA (Weight-Decomposed LoRA)"
    **DoRA Innovation** (Liu et al., 2024): Decomposes weight updates into magnitude and direction components

    $$
    W' = \frac{\|W_0\|_c}{\|W_0 + BA\|_c} (W_0 + BA)
    $$

    where $\|\cdot\|_c$ denotes column-wise norm.

    **Key Insight**: Separates learning of weight magnitudes from weight directions, leading to better performance.

=== "Advanced Variants"
    **Recent Developments**:

    - **AdaLoRA**: Adaptive rank allocation during training
    - **QLoRA**: Quantized LoRA for extreme efficiency
    - **LoRA+**: Improved initialization and learning rate strategies

    **Mathematical Innovation**: Each variant addresses different aspects of the low-rank constraint while maintaining computational efficiency.

!!! tip "üî¨ Linear Algebra Insights"
    **Why Low-Rank Works**:

    1. **Intrinsic dimensionality**: Many learning tasks have lower intrinsic dimensionality than the full parameter space
    2. **Rank-nullity theorem**: $\text{rank}(W) + \text{nullity}(W) = \min(d,k)$
    3. **Spectral properties**: Most important information is captured in the top singular values

    **Research Finding**: Analysis of pre-trained models shows that fine-tuning updates often have very low intrinsic rank, validating the low-rank assumption.

## 5. Inner Products and Orthogonality

!!! abstract "üîë Key Concept: Inner Product"
    An **inner product** provides a way to measure angles and lengths in vector spaces. It's the mathematical foundation for similarity measures, attention mechanisms, and optimization in machine learning.

### 5.1 Inner Product Spaces

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Inner Product"
    An **inner product** on a vector space $V$ is a function $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies:

    1. **Symmetry**: $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u} \rangle$
    2. **Linearity in first argument**: $\langle a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \rangle = a\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{w} \rangle + b\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \rangle$
    3. **Positive definiteness**: $\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle \geq 0$ with equality iff $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$

!!! example "üî¢ Standard Inner Products"

    === "Euclidean Inner Product"
        In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the standard inner product (dot product) is:

        $$\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i = \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{v}$$

    === "Weighted Inner Product"
        With positive weights $w_1, \ldots, w_n$:

        $$\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle_w = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i u_i v_i$$

    === "Matrix Inner Product"
        For matrices $A, B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$:

        $$\langle A, B \rangle = \text{tr}(A^TB) = \sum_{i,j} A_{ij}B_{ij}$$

!!! tip "üí° Derived Concepts"
    From the inner product, we can define:

    - **Norm (Length)**: $\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle}$
    - **Distance**: $d(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|$
    - **Angle**: $\cos \theta = \frac{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\|\mathbf{u}\|\|\mathbf{v}\|}$

### 5.2 Orthogonality and Orthonormal Bases

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Orthogonality"
    Two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are **orthogonal** (written $\mathbf{u} \perp \mathbf{v}$) if:

    $$\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0$$

    A set of vectors is **orthogonal** if every pair is orthogonal. It's **orthonormal** if it's orthogonal and every vector has unit length.

!!! example "üîç Orthogonal Sets"

    === "Standard Basis"
        The standard basis $\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is orthonormal:

        $$\langle \mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j \rangle = \delta_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i = j \\ 0 & \text{if } i \neq j \end{cases}$$

    === "Gram-Schmidt Process"
        Any linearly independent set can be converted to an orthonormal set using the Gram-Schmidt process:

        $$\mathbf{u}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{v}_1}{\|\mathbf{v}_1\|}$$

        $$\mathbf{u}_k = \frac{\mathbf{v}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \langle \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle \mathbf{u}_j}{\|\mathbf{v}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \langle \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle \mathbf{u}_j\|}$$

!!! tip "‚ú® Benefits of Orthonormal Bases"
    Working with orthonormal bases simplifies many computations:

    - **Coordinate calculation**: $\mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^n \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}_i \rangle \mathbf{u}_i$
    - **Projection formula**: $\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u} \rangle} \mathbf{u}$
    - **Orthogonal matrix properties**: $Q^TQ = I$ for orthogonal matrix $Q$

### 5.3 Applications in Attention Mechanisms

!!! example "ü§ñ Attention as Inner Products"
    The core of attention mechanisms relies heavily on inner products for computing similarities.

    === "Scaled Dot-Product Attention"
        The attention weights are computed using inner products:

        $$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

        where $QK^T$ contains all pairwise inner products $\langle \mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{k}_j \rangle$.

        **Research Note**: The original "Attention is All You Need" paper (Vaswani et al., 2017) chose dot-product attention over additive attention due to its computational efficiency and better performance in practice.

    === "Cosine Similarity"
        Normalized inner products measure cosine similarity:

        $$\text{sim}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \frac{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\|\mathbf{u}\|\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \cos \theta$$

        This is widely used in:
        - Word embedding similarity
        - Document similarity
        - Recommendation systems

        **Key Insight**: When embeddings are normalized, cosine similarity equals the dot product, making attention mechanisms essentially cosine similarity-based retrieval systems.

    === "Self-Attention Interpretation"
        In self-attention, each token computes its similarity with all other tokens using inner products. High similarity (large inner product) leads to high attention weights.

        **Recent Research**: Studies show that attention patterns often correspond to syntactic and semantic relationships, with inner products capturing linguistic dependencies in the embedding space.

!!! warning "‚ö†Ô∏è Scaling in Attention"
    The scaling factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ in scaled dot-product attention prevents the inner products from becoming too large, which would cause the softmax to saturate and gradients to vanish.

### 5.4 Linear Relational Concepts

!!! example "üîó Linear Relations in Embedding Spaces (NAACL 2024)"
    Recent research by Chanin et al. demonstrates that large language models implement linear relational concepts, where relationships between entities can be captured through linear transformations in embedding space.

!!! note "üìê Mathematical Framework for Linear Relations"
    **Core Concept**: A linear relational concept $R$ can be represented as a linear transformation that maps subject embeddings to object embeddings:

    $$
    \mathbf{v}_{\text{object}} \approx \mathbf{v}_{\text{subject}} + \mathbf{r}_R
    $$

    where $\mathbf{r}_R$ is a **relation vector** that encodes the relationship $R$.

=== "Relation Vector Extraction"
    **Method**: Given pairs $(s_i, o_i)$ that satisfy relation $R$:

    $$
    \mathbf{r}_R = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\mathbf{v}_{o_i} - \mathbf{v}_{s_i})
    $$

    **Examples**:
    - "Capital of": $\mathbf{v}_{\text{Paris}} - \mathbf{v}_{\text{France}} \approx \mathbf{r}_{\text{capital}}$
    - "Plural of": $\mathbf{v}_{\text{cats}} - \mathbf{v}_{\text{cat}} \approx \mathbf{r}_{\text{plural}}$

=== "Linear Relational Probing"
    **Probe Training**: Learn a linear classifier to predict if relation $R$ holds:

    $$
    P(R(s,o)) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}_R^T (\mathbf{v}_o - \mathbf{v}_s) + b_R)
    $$

    **Interpretation**: If the probe achieves high accuracy, the relation is **linearly encoded** in the embedding space.

=== "Compositional Relations"
    **Relation Composition**: Complex relations can be composed from simpler ones:

    $$
    \mathbf{r}_{R_1 \circ R_2} \approx \mathbf{r}_{R_1} + \mathbf{r}_{R_2}
    $$

    **Example**: "Grandmother" ‚âà "Mother" + "Mother"

!!! tip "üî¨ Research Implications"
    **Key Findings** (Chanin et al., NAACL 2024):

    1. **Linear structure**: Many semantic relationships are linearly encoded in LLM embeddings
    2. **Consistency across models**: Similar linear patterns appear in different model architectures
    3. **Transferability**: Relation vectors learned from one domain often transfer to related domains

    **Practical Applications**:
    - **Knowledge editing**: Modify model knowledge by adjusting relation vectors
    - **Interpretability**: Understand what relationships models have learned
    - **Evaluation**: Test model understanding of semantic relationships

!!! example "üíª Implementation Example"
    ```python
    # Extract relation vector for "capital of" relationship
    def extract_relation_vector(model, country_capital_pairs):
        relation_vectors = []
        for country, capital in country_capital_pairs:
            country_emb = model.get_embedding(country)
            capital_emb = model.get_embedding(capital)
            relation_vectors.append(capital_emb - country_emb)

        # Average to get stable relation vector
        return torch.stack(relation_vectors).mean(dim=0)

    # Use relation vector for prediction
    def predict_capital(model, country, relation_vector):
        country_emb = model.get_embedding(country)
        predicted_capital_emb = country_emb + relation_vector
        return model.find_nearest_token(predicted_capital_emb)
    ```

## 6. Advanced Topics for LLMs

!!! abstract "üöÄ Advanced Concepts"
    These advanced linear algebra concepts are crucial for understanding the theoretical foundations and practical limitations of large language models.

### 6.1 Rank and Nullspace

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Matrix Rank"
    The **rank** of a matrix $A$ is the dimension of its column space (or row space). It represents the number of linearly independent columns (or rows).

    - **Full rank**: $\text{rank}(A) = \min(m, n)$ for an $m \times n$ matrix
    - **Rank deficient**: $\text{rank}(A) < \min(m, n)$

!!! note "üìñ Definition: Nullspace"
    The **nullspace** (or kernel) of matrix $A$ is:

    $$\text{null}(A) = \{\mathbf{x} : A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\}$$

    The **rank-nullity theorem** states:

    $$\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n$$

    where $n$ is the number of columns and nullity is the dimension of the nullspace.

!!! example "üß† ML Applications of Rank"

    === "Model Capacity"
        - **High rank**: Model can represent complex functions
        - **Low rank**: Model has limited expressiveness but better generalization

    === "Low-Rank Approximations"
        Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) use low-rank matrices to efficiently fine-tune large models:

        $$W' = W + AB$$

        where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, and $r \ll \min(m,n)$.

        **Recent Developments**:
        - **LoRA-Null** (2025): Uses null space projections to better preserve pre-trained knowledge
        - **InfLoRA** (2024): Interference-free adaptation for continual learning
        - **Weight-Decomposed LoRA**: Improves upon standard LoRA by decomposing weights more effectively

    === "Singular Value Decomposition"
        SVD decomposes any matrix as:

        $$A = U\Sigma V^T$$

        This is fundamental to:
        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
        - Matrix factorization techniques

### 6.2 Change of Basis and Coordinate Systems

!!! note "üìñ Change of Basis"
    Given two bases $\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{b}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_n\}$ and $\mathcal{C} = \{\mathbf{c}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{c}_n\}$ for vector space $V$, the **change of basis matrix** $P$ satisfies:

    $$[\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{C}} = P[\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}}$$

    where $[\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}}$ denotes the coordinate vector of $\mathbf{v}$ with respect to basis $\mathcal{B}$.

!!! example "üîÑ Applications in Neural Networks"

    === "Layer Transformations"
        Each layer in a neural network can be viewed as changing the coordinate system (basis) for representing the data.

    === "Feature Learning"
        Neural networks learn to transform inputs into coordinate systems where the target task becomes easier to solve.

        **Research Insight**: Geometric deep learning shows that equivariant neural networks explicitly handle coordinate system changes, making them more robust to transformations in the input space.

    === "Representation Learning"
        The goal is often to find a basis where:
        - Similar inputs have similar coordinates
        - Task-relevant features are emphasized
        - Noise and irrelevant information are suppressed

        **Modern Approach**: Fourier features and positional encodings help networks learn high-frequency functions by providing appropriate coordinate systems for different frequency components.

### 6.3 Healthcare Applications and Case Studies

    Linear algebra concepts are fundamental to healthcare applications of large language models.

    === "Medical Text Analysis"
        **Vector Space Models for Clinical Notes**

        - **Similarity search**: Finding similar cases using cosine similarity (inner products)
        - **Clustering**: Grouping patients with similar conditions using distance metrics

        **Example**: A clinical decision support system uses vector representations to find patients with similar symptoms and treatment outcomes.

        **Real-World Application**: Recent studies show that transformer-based language models can identify prediabetes discussions in clinical narratives using vector embeddings, demonstrating the power of linear algebra in healthcare NLP.

    === "Drug Discovery"
        **Molecular Representation Learning**

        - **Chemical fingerprints**: Molecules represented as binary vectors
        - **Similarity matrices**: Drug-drug interactions computed using inner products

        **Linear transformations** map molecular structures to property predictions.

        **Current Research**: Large language models are being adapted for drug discovery, using linear algebra to process molecular representations and predict drug-target interactions.

    === "Medical Imaging Integration"
        **Multimodal Fusion**

        - **Image embeddings**: Radiological images projected into vector spaces
        - **Text-image alignment**: Using linear transformations to align textual descriptions with visual features
        - **Attention mechanisms**: Focusing on relevant image regions using inner product-based attention

        **Clinical Impact**: Task-specific transformer models are revolutionizing healthcare by advancing clinical decision support, patient interaction, and medical education through sophisticated linear algebra operations.

!!! tip "üí° Practical Implementation"
    **PyTorch Example: Medical Text Similarity**

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    # Medical document embeddings (simplified)
    doc1 = torch.randn(768)  # Patient A's clinical notes
    doc2 = torch.randn(768)  # Patient B's clinical notes
    doc3 = torch.randn(768)  # Patient C's clinical notes

    # Normalize embeddings for cosine similarity
    doc1_norm = F.normalize(doc1, p=2, dim=0)
    doc2_norm = F.normalize(doc2, p=2, dim=0)
    doc3_norm = F.normalize(doc3, p=2, dim=0)

    # Compute similarities using inner products
    sim_12 = torch.dot(doc1_norm, doc2_norm)
    sim_13 = torch.dot(doc1_norm, doc3_norm)
    sim_23 = torch.dot(doc2_norm, doc3_norm)

    print(f"Similarity between Patient A and B: {sim_12:.3f}")
    print(f"Similarity between Patient A and C: {sim_13:.3f}")
    print(f"Similarity between Patient B and C: {sim_23:.3f}")
