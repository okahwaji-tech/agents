# Mathematical Foundations

Essential mathematical concepts for understanding Large Language Models and agentic workflows.

## üéØ Overview

This section covers the mathematical foundations you need to understand how LLMs work at a deep level. These concepts are fundamental to everything from basic text prediction to advanced agent architectures.

## üìö Topics Covered

### Core Mathematics
- **[Probability Theory](probability-theory.md)** - The foundation of language modeling
- **[Information Theory](information-theory.md)** - Entropy, cross-entropy, and perplexity
- **[Linear Algebra](linear-algebra.md)** - Vector operations and matrix mathematics

### Advanced Topics
- **[Matrix Operations](matrix-multiplication.md)** - Essential computations for neural networks
- **[Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors](eigenvalues-eigenvectors.md)** - Advanced linear algebra concepts

## üßÆ Why These Matter

Each mathematical concept directly applies to LLMs:

| Concept | Application in LLMs |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Probability Theory** | Token prediction, language modeling objective |
| **Information Theory** | Loss functions, model evaluation metrics |
| **Linear Algebra** | Embeddings, attention mechanisms, transformations |
| **Vector Spaces** | Semantic similarity, word relationships |
| **Matrix Operations** | Neural network computations, attention |
| **Eigenvalues** | Understanding attention patterns, dimensionality |

## üè• Healthcare Applications
