# LLM Fundamentals

Core concepts and techniques for understanding and working with Large Language Models.

## 🎯 Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts you need to understand how Large Language Models work, from basic text representation to advanced evaluation techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Core Concepts
- **[Introduction to LLMs](llm-fundamentals.md)** - What are LLMs and how do they work?
- **[Word Embeddings](word-embeddings.md)** - How text becomes vectors
- **[Evaluation Methods](evaluation.md)** - How to measure LLM performance

## 🧠 Key LLM Concepts

Understanding these fundamentals is essential:

| Concept | Description | Why Important |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tokenization** | Converting text to numbers | Foundation of all LLM processing |
| **Embeddings** | Vector representations of text | How models understand meaning |
| **Attention** | Focusing on relevant parts | Core mechanism of Transformers |
| **Generation** | Creating new text | Primary capability of LLMs |
| **Evaluation** | Measuring performance | Ensuring quality and safety |

## 🏥 Healthcare Applications

LLM fundamentals are crucial for healthcare AI:
