# Machine Learning Foundations

Core machine learning concepts with focus on reinforcement learning and its connections to LLMs.

## üéØ Overview

This section covers machine learning fundamentals, with particular emphasis on reinforcement learning concepts that are crucial for understanding modern LLM training techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).

## üìö Topics Covered

### Reinforcement Learning
- **[Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement-learning.md)** - Introduction to RL concepts and applications to language models
- **[Markov Decision Processes](mdp.md)** - Mathematical framework for sequential decisions

## üîó Why RL Matters for LLMs

Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly important in LLM development:

| RL Concept | LLM Application |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Sequential Decision Making** | Text generation as choosing next tokens |
| **Reward Functions** | Human preference learning (RLHF) |
| **Policy Learning** | Training models to follow instructions |
| **Exploration vs Exploitation** | Balancing creativity and accuracy |
| **Value Functions** | Estimating quality of generated text |

## üè• Healthcare Applications

RL concepts are particularly relevant in healthcare AI:

- **Treatment planning** as sequential decision making
- **Clinical workflows** as multi-step processes
- **Risk-benefit analysis** using value functions
- **Adaptive protocols** that learn from outcomes

## üöÄ Modern LLM Training

Understanding these RL concepts is essential for:

- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** - How ChatGPT and Claude are trained
- **Constitutional AI** - Training models with principles and values
- **Agent architectures** - LLMs that can take actions in environments
- **Tool use** - Models that learn to use external tools effectively

## üìà Learning Path

**Recommended Order:**

1. **[Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement-learning.md)** - Start with basic concepts and LLM applications
2. **[Markov Decision Processes](mdp.md)** - Mathematical foundations

**Time Investment:** 2-3 hours for core concepts
