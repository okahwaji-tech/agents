2. **Information Theory** - The mathematical basis of training objectives
3. **Linear Algebra** - Vector operations fundamental to neural networks
4. **Reinforcement Learning** - Sequential decision-making frameworks

## üßÆ Probability Theory Fundamentals

### Why It Matters
Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of how LLMs work. Every prediction an LLM makes is fundamentally a probability distribution over possible next tokens.

### Key Concepts

#### Discrete and Continuous Distributions
- **Discrete**: Probability mass functions for token predictions
- **Continuous**: Probability density functions for embedding spaces
- **Practice**: Calculate probabilities for simple language sequences

#### Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
```
P(word|context) = P(context|word) √ó P(word) / P(context)
```

This is exactly what language models learn to estimate!

#### Chain Rule of Probability
```
P(w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô) = P(w‚ÇÅ) √ó P(w‚ÇÇ|w‚ÇÅ) √ó P(w‚ÇÉ|w‚ÇÅ,w‚ÇÇ) √ó ... √ó P(w‚Çô|w‚ÇÅ,...,w‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
```

This is the mathematical foundation of autoregressive language modeling.

### Healthcare Applications
- **Medical diagnosis**: P(disease|symptoms)
- **Drug interactions**: P(interaction|drug‚ÇÅ, drug‚ÇÇ)
- **Clinical outcomes**: P(outcome|treatment, patient_history)

- Interactive probability calculators
- Practice problems with medical examples

## üìà Information Theory Basics

### Why It Matters
Information theory provides the mathematical framework for understanding:
- Why cross-entropy is the natural loss function for language modeling
- How to measure model uncertainty and confidence
- The theoretical limits of language model performance

### Key Concepts

#### Entropy
Measures the uncertainty in a probability distribution:
```
H(X) = -‚àë P(x) log P(x)
```

#### Cross-Entropy Loss
The loss function used to train language models:
```
L = -‚àë y log(≈∑)
```

#### Perplexity
A measure of how well a language model predicts text:
```
Perplexity = 2^(cross-entropy)
```

Lower perplexity = better model performance.

### Healthcare Applications
- **Model confidence**: Measuring uncertainty in medical predictions
- **Information content**: How much information medical terms carry
- **Compression**: Efficient representation of medical knowledge

### Resources
- [Detailed Information Theory Guide](information-theory.md)
- Entropy calculation examples
- Perplexity computation tools

## üî¢ Linear Algebra Review

### Why It Matters
Linear algebra is the computational foundation of neural networks:
- Embeddings are vectors in high-dimensional spaces
- Attention mechanisms use matrix operations
- All neural network computations are linear algebra

### Key Concepts

#### Vector Spaces and Operations
- **Vector addition**: Combining semantic meanings
- **Scalar multiplication**: Scaling semantic intensity
- **Dot products**: Measuring similarity between concepts

#### Matrix Multiplication
The fundamental operation in neural networks:
```python
# Attention computation example
attention_weights = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k))
output = attention_weights @ V
```

#### Distance Metrics
- **Euclidean distance**: Geometric similarity
- **Cosine similarity**: Semantic similarity (most common in NLP)
- **Manhattan distance**: Alternative similarity measure

### Healthcare Applications
- **Medical concept similarity**: Measuring relationships between diseases
- **Drug embeddings**: Vector representations of medications
- **Clinical note analysis**: Semantic similarity of medical text

- [Matrix Operations Tutorial](matrix-multiplication.md)
- [Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors](eigenvalues-eigenvectors.md)

## üéÆ Reinforcement Learning Foundations

### Why It Matters
While LLMs are primarily trained with supervised learning, RL concepts are crucial for:
- Understanding modern alignment techniques (RLHF)
- Building LLM agents that interact with environments
- Optimizing for human preferences rather than just likelihood

### Key Concepts

#### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
The mathematical framework for sequential decision-making:
- **States**: Current context or situation
- **Actions**: Possible next tokens or decisions
- **Rewards**: Feedback signals (human preferences)
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions

#### Connection to Language Modeling
- **State**: Current text context
- **Action**: Next token to generate
- **Reward**: Human preference or task success
- **Policy**: The language model's probability distribution

### Healthcare Applications
- **Treatment planning**: Sequential medical decisions
- **Clinical workflows**: Multi-step diagnostic processes
- **Patient interaction**: Adaptive conversation strategies
