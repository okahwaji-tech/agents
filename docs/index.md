# LLM & Agentic Workflows Learning Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive learning repository for **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **agentic workflows** with a focus on healthcare applications.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is designed as a structured learning path for mastering LLMs and building agentic AI systems, with particular emphasis on healthcare applications at Allergan Data Labs. The curriculum integrates mathematical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world healthcare use cases.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📚 Comprehensive Study Guide**: 24-week structured curriculum covering LLM fundamentals to advanced agentic systems
- **🧮 Mathematical Foundations**: Deep dive into the mathematics behind LLMs, transformers, and reinforcement learning
- **🏥 Healthcare Focus**: Specialized applications for medical AI, clinical decision support, and healthcare safety
- **💻 Hands-on Code**: PyTorch implementations optimized for Apple Silicon M3 Ultra
- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress tables for each week's learning objectives
- **🔬 Research Integration**: Latest papers and techniques in LLM and AI agent research

## 🏗️ Architecture

The learning path is organized into four main phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation LLM Architecture (Weeks 1-6)
Build fundamental understanding of LLMs, Transformer architecture, and basic usage.

### Phase 2: Advanced LLM Techniques (Weeks 7-12)
Master fine-tuning, alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, and multimodal systems.

### Phase 3: LLM Agents and Tool Use (Weeks 13-18)
Learn to build autonomous agents that can use tools and interact with environments.

### Phase 4: Advanced Agent Architectures (Weeks 19-24)
Explore multi-agent systems, planning, reasoning, and complex agent architectures.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
