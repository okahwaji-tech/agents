## üíª Hands-On Deliverable

### Project: First LLM Healthcare Application

Build your first LLM application with healthcare focus to establish technical foundations.

#### Step 1: Environment Setup (1 hour)

```bash
# Activate your environment
source agents/bin/activate

# Verify installation
python test_apple_silicon.py

# Install additional dependencies if needed
uv sync --extra dev
```

#### Step 2: First LLM Program (1.5 hours)

Create a Python script to:

- Load GPT-2 (small) using Hugging Face Transformers
- Implement text generation with temperature and top-k sampling
- Test with medical and general prompts
- Compare model behavior on different text types

**Example Implementation:**

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def load_gpt2_model() -> tuple[GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer]:
    """Load GPT-2 model optimized for Apple Silicon."""
    model_name = "gpt2"
    
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    # Add padding token
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
    
    # Move to MPS if available
    device = torch.device('mps' if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else 'cpu')
    model = model.to(device)
    
    return model, tokenizer

def generate_text(
    model: GPT2LMHeadModel,
    tokenizer: GPT2Tokenizer,
    prompt: str,
    max_length: int = 100,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    top_k: int = 50
) -> str:
    """Generate text with specified parameters."""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### Step 3: Mathematical Analysis (0.5 hours)

- Analyze probability distributions of predictions
- Compare model confidence across different domains
- Document uncertainty patterns

#### Step 4: Documentation and Reflection (1 hour)

Create a comprehensive report covering:

## üîÑ Reinforcement Learning Focus

### Connecting RL to Language Modeling

While this week focuses on supervised learning, understanding RL connections is crucial:

#### 1. Sequential Decision Making Perspective
Language generation as sequential decision-making where models choose tokens at each step.

#### 2. Reward Signals in Language
Traditional likelihood vs. human preferences as reward signals in modern alignment.

#### 3. Agent-Environment Framework
LLMs as agents interacting with conversation context and receiving feedback.

#### 4. Exploration vs. Exploitation
Temperature and sampling parameters control the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

!!! tip "Future Connection"
    These concepts become crucial for RLHF in Week 8 and LLM agents in Phase 4.
